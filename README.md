# Stock-prediction-Regression

## Algorithms used:
Regularized Regression algos: Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet

Tree Ensemble algos: RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor

## Regression

To convert Time series problem into Regression, We have used past window data to predict the next value after the window period. Which means each sample in window period acts as Parameter.

## Model evaluation
k-Fold Cross-Validation, R^2 and MAE were used to estimate the model performance.

## Result
Ridge performed better than other models.
